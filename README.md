# Diamond Kinetics coding challenge

# Assumptions for the problem:
1. The operations can run on any of the 7 columns (including timestamp).
2. The data is clean (no null or blank entries).
3. I have used the data type double for timestamp to reduce the lines of code.
4. The file latestSwing.csv is in the same folder from where this code is executed. (Relative path is used)

# Files
1. Driver.java : Execution starts from here.
2. Operations.java: Contains the 4 operations that you asked me to implement.
3. SwingData.java: Data Structure which you asked me to implement.
4. SwingFileReader: Reads the lastestSwing.csv file into the data structure.

# Note
you just need to change values in the Driver.java class to test different scenarios. All four operations are called from there.
